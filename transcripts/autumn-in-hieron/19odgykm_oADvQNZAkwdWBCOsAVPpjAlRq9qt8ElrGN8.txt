conducAn Introduction to Friends at the Table

Transcriber: Ilias

Austin:
Hey, everyone my name is Austin Walker, I'm the host, GM, and co-creator of Friends at the Table, which is an actual play podcast focused on critical world building, smart characterization, and fun interactions between good friends.
Maybe you know some of our cast from one of the other podcasts that we do like Emojidrome or Waypoint Radio, or you heard us guests on something like the Great Gundam Project or the Giant Bombcast, or you saw the show's name in an article or had a very exhuberent friend recommend us to you with a lot of excitement.
However you got here, thanks for giving us a shot! I'm going ot do my best to make sure that we don't squander that opportunity by giving you some advice on where you can start the show!  Because there is a LOT of show, and honestly there isn't just one good place to hop on--but I do have some thoughts on what might work best.
Broadly, we're an actual play podcast, like I said before. Which means we play tabletop roleplaying games and story games in order to tell stories together. It's sort of like a collaborative writer's room with some dice thrown in. Thankfully in 2020 a lot of people already know what that is, thanks to shows like Critical Role or The Adventure Zone. So I'm going to talk assuming that you have some idea about what it means to be a podcast like ours.
If you want something short and sweet to get to know some of us and the style of stories we tell, then check out the three part Fall of Magic series which starts at September 14th, 2018 in our main feed. It's a light, but melancholy story about magic leaving a fantastical world and a great mage and her companions who are on a journey to restore it. It was originally a series of live streams which means that things are kind of loose and playful, it all has a sort of of Studio Ghibli vibe. And again, 3 episodes, in and out. A great starting place.
If you wanna stick with fantasy but want something a little meatier, then let me recommend jumping on board with Marielda, which starts on July 14th, 2016 in your feed. In Marielda we begin with Avery Alder's The Quiet Year to build a custom, industrial fantasy setting filled with ingenious inventors, curious creatures, and broken hearted gods, and then we play out a campaign in that setting using John Harper's incredible Blades in the Dark. Plus, it's a great jumping on point for our now complete Fantasy series Seasons of Hieron. Marielda is a prequel story, you don't need to know anything about Hieron before listening. And when it ends, the episodes that follow are a clip show of everything that came before Marielda, which means you can jump right in to the second season fo Hieron after you finish our campaign of Blades in the Dark.
If fantasy isn't your thing, then we've still got a lot of options for you. Our current season, PARTIZAN, is frankly one of the best we've had. It takes place at the heart of a corrupt galactic empire, where the very first dreams of revolution begin to stir in those who live there. We play Austin Ramsay's Beam Saber along with some other games, and it's great. It's about compromised characters, backdoor politicking, and tremendously powerful robotic gods called Divines. If you like Mobile Suit Gundam or Escaflowne or Crusader Kings II, PARTIZAN is the place for you. Plus, if you catch up, you'll be able to listen week to week along with the audience which is always really fun. I suggest starting at PARTIZAN 00, which is a character creation episode, or 01 if you want to get right into it.
If you want to hear how we first conceived of Divines, then you can go way back to July 15, 2015, when we started COUNTER/Weight, our first sci-fi season. We play a bunch of stuff again: We use Jeremy Keller's TechNoir and Haimsh Cameron's The Sprawl to follow a group of cyberpunks, fixers, and mech pilots, and we zoom out from time to time to use the faction rules in Stars Without Number to follow things frmo a grander, more faction-scale level. COUNTER/Weight is probably my favorite season all said, but it does get off to a sort of rocky start, so I definitely suggest PARTIZAN first, unless you're someone who HAS to hear everything in release order.
Finally, there's Bluff City, which isn't in this feed, but its first season is free on our Patreon. You can access it by going to tinyurl.com/freebluff. Bluff City is an anthology series, where we use a bunch of different games, including Masks, World Wide Wrestling RPG, Inspecrtres, Fiasco, and others to tell the stories of an uncanny version of Atlantic City. It has some of my favorite moments and characters and player performances, and I really recommend that people give it a listen!
There are so many other things I could reccomend, but these are best jumping on points. If you give them a shot and like them, then hit us up on Twitter at Friends_Table to get more recommendations of what to listen to (or ask our incredible fans using the hashtag #friendsatthetable.
Like I said, we also have a Patreon, which you can reach at friendsatthetable.cash, which has a BUNCH of other stuff if you feel like supporting us after giving some of our stuff a listen. That includes Live at the Table, a monthly livestream where we do one shots of a bunch of different games, Tips at the Table a roundtable Q&A show where we answer your questions about RPGs, table manners, storytelling, recording podcasts, basically everything and anything people might ask. And I do a show called Drawing Maps, which is a mix of streamed stuff and podcasts where I pull back the curtain on my game prep and also take soem GMing questions from the audience. ALL of those things I said are part of the 5 dollar a month tier. There's more stuff after that, but honestly, even just that stuff is a lot to talk about. OH also, even 1 dollar backers get the clapcast, which is like the cutting room floor, out of character jokey bits from the warm up conversation before we start doing the main show recordings. It's all good, and it honestly is amazing the degree of support y'all have shown us there and honestly everywhere across the internet.
We are a small show--much much smaller than I think people might assume--but our fans have helped us cast a pretty large shadow, which rules. So, I hope if you give us a shot, you'll see what those fans have come to love over the years too. And hey, if you give us a shot and it's not for you, then no worries, you gave it a shot, and that's all I can ask from anyone.
Oh, and I should also shout out Jack de Quidt, another member of the cast who is also an incredible composer who does a ton of great music for the show. You can find all that music at notquitereal.bandcamp.com, including this song which is the intro to Fall of Magic. Thanks so much. Peace.


Welcome to Friends at the Table, an actual play podcast focused on critical worldbuilding, smart characterization, and fun interaction between good friends. I'm Austin Walker, your host and GM, and today, the day I'm recording this mini episode, is the third anniversary of our show. Which sounded to me like a good excuse to record an updated introduction to what this show even is.

It is an actual play podcast, like I said just a few seconds ago, which basically means that my friends and I use tabletop roleplaying games to tell stories together. We create characters, describe fantastic places, go on adventures, investigate mysteries. We linger on hard questions about morality, politics, the future, the past, and we tell jokes, lots of jokes, and we google various animal facts. We do that last one a lot. We spent a whole season in a world that basically didn't have any animals, and we still managed to google for animal facts.

If that sounds interesting to you, then rad: let me tell you where you might want to start. And hey, if that doesn't sound rad to you, then that's also cool. But maybe your friends have been bugging you to give us a listen, and you're like "okay, fine, Linda, I'll listen to this show that you're obsessed with," and you need to at least listen to a couple of episodes to prove you're a good friend - well, I'll give you some suggested starting places too.

We are currently in the fourth season of Friends at the Table, and I think it's a pretty great place to jump on board. The show is called Twilight Mirage, and in it we play cyberpunk roleplaying game The Veil, by Frasier Simons, which has a unique mechanic that explores the emotional states of the player characters. While Twilight Mirage technically takes place in the same sci-fi universe as a past season, there aren't any recurring characters, and references are pretty limited. This is a stand-alone story that explores a declining utopia called the Divine Fleet, which is named that because it's protected and guided by super powerful and surprisingly benevolent robots called Divines.

This season is split into two groups. One is a trio of secret agents - a cat-girl hacker, a priestess to one of the Divines, and a bounty hunter made from decaying data - who investigate threats to this once-peaceful civilization, and also work to help the ordinary, vulnerable people left behind as their safety nets and once-reliable infrastructure begin to fail. The other half of the game takes place on a mysterious planet, where the players are desperately searching for a new home for their culture's refugees, all while adventuring through the ruins of an ancient society and navigating through the intrigues of a new one. So, if you're interested in science fantasy, giant mechs, the politics of technology, strange alien worlds, or if you just want to be part of the ongoing conversation around Friends at the Table, then Twilight Mirage is a good place to start.

In Episode 0, we create the world, with each player designing a Divine and one of the ships of the fleet that's associated with it. Or you can jump ahead to Episode 1, which takes you right to the action as the players try to foil an assassination attempt on one of the fleet's most important members.

If sci-fi and mechs are your thing, but you're more interested in devouring an already fully-told story, which is totally a cool thing to do - I totally get it - then let me recommend Counter/Weight, our second season, and frankly the thing I am most proud of bringing into the world. Seriously, it means that much to me. [Also, important note: I have not had any children; that will probably change at some point if I ever have any children, but I have not yet, and for now Counter/Weight is my favorite baby.]

If Twilight Mirage is an optimistic science fantasy story, then C/W is its dark reflection. It's a little less Escaflowne, a little more Gundam; a little less Destiny, a little more Blade Runner. It follows a rag-tag group of cyberpunk fixers as they stumble their way into the center of a galactic crisis. There are vaporwave hackers and pop-idol revolutionaries, exiled princes and a robot who is Very Good at flying a spaceship.

Counter/Weight is mostly, but not entirely, played in The Sprawl, by Hamish Cameron, and it was the perfect game for the story we wanted to tell, one about high risks and even higher ideals. We also dip into other games when it makes sense in the story, and we regularly zoom out of the action to play out the events of the entire star sector, telling the stories of plodding megacorp executives and misunderstood villains, star pirates and the machinations of uh- I don't want to give too much away. Just listen to Counter/Weight, please, seriously, listen to Counter/Weight.

The first episode, Episode 0, is a character-building episode, so you Could skip it, but I actually think it's pretty important to wrap your head around for the show, so I would start there. We also, just so you know, switch out the game we- we use primarily around episode 10, so if you're digging it but are wishing things were a little smoother, stick it out, the show gets there.

I know that's been a lot of sci-fi in a row, and I know a lot of you are coming here from fantasy shows, and love fantasy, and I get it, I totally understand, and we have you covered, so. Our largest fictional universe is, in fact, a fantasy one; it's a place called Hieron, and it's where the first and third seasons of the show take place, as well as an interlude game which I will get to a little bit later. Seasons of Hieron, the name of this ongoing story, takes place in a post-post-apocalyptic fantasy setting. What that means is, you know - Imagine if all the orcs and elves of Tolkien or traditional D&D settings all lived through or suffered through a terrible calamity ages ago, and then things were really bad, things were, like, Terrible, for a long time, but now? You know, things are still not Great, but they're getting better. There're towns and cities that are popping back up on the map, travel and commerce are possible in ways that people had forgotten, and most importantly this new society, and the long dark age between the old one and this new one, has offered everyone the chance to redefine themselves and their cultures. It's a way for us to both engage in the high-adventure fantasy of the roleplaying game Dungeon World, which is by Sage LaTorra and Adam Koebel, while also deconstructing some of the elements of fantasy that have bugged us for a long time. You won't find any savage orcs or endlessly wise elves here, for instance. Everything is a little more complex than that.

Now, what I wish I could say is "so go ahead and start at episode one," but I can't quite do that, because when we started the show we were doing it on cheap USB headsets and without a real idea of what it could or would become. Which means the first season's audio is a little rough, and the first five or so episodes in particular are especially hard to listen to if you're used to something sounding a little more professional - which thankfully, thanks to our great producer Ali, our show now does sound like that, and also thanks to the support of patrons, which I'll get to in a little bit, but that means we've also all been able to get better audio equipment. I'll also say briefly that those first few episodes are a little slow; they were our first attempt at telling a story through tabletop roleplaying games, right? So. I still think they're great, as your friend Linda, or whoever, has probably also told you already, but I do want to give you that heads-up with that show. That said, if you're dedicated to starting from the very beginning, then go for it. Just know that those first few eps are a bit of a doozy, quality-wise.

There is a bit of a hack for this, though. If you really want to get into our fantasy world - if you really want to get into Hieron - but aren't ready to listen to rough audio quality, or if you're looking for just a self-contained digestible story that gives you a taste of what Friends at the Table is, then what you should listen to is Marielda, the mini-season that ran between seasons two and three. Remember how I said that Seasons of Hieron took place in a post-post-apocalyptic fantasy world? Well, Marielda takes place in the years just prior to that apocalypse, in a little island city run by a jealous god, policed by living statues, and home to all sorts of scoundrels. Like, for instance, the Six, the most influential groups of thieves the city has ever known - also, the players. While other criminals pick pockets, or rob bank vaults, the Six go out there and steal knowledge itself.

Marielda is great from the first episode, from Episode 1, which is a world-building episode where we use a game called The Quiet Year, by Avery McDoldnaugh to sketch out the history of the city. Then in Episode 3, we start playing John Harper's Blades in the Dark which is a game about a sort of steampunk group of thieves. [I do want to say briefly that Marielda does have some steampunk qualities, but just like trains and guns, not, like, weird defenses of European colonialism. It is still a - like all of our shows - something that is, you know, pretty interested in exploring issues of race and class and culture, just alongside us googling how big dogs can get. That's kind of the Friends at the Table promise.]

If you need to pick one episode to listen to, absolutely positively pick one to listen to, I think Marielda Episode 3 is the one. It has some great characterization, it's a fun introduction to a unique world, and frankly, there is one incredibly surprising moment from a player that is going to stick with me forever, and hopefully to all of our listeners.

That, all of that, Hieron, Counter/Weight, Twilight Mirage, Marielda - that is friends at the table, or at least that's everything that's in the feed you're listening to right now. There is also a ton of other stuff that we do for our patrons over at friendsatthetable.cash, which will take you to our Patreon, including a patron-only campaign that takes place in a fictional version of Atlantic City that has its own fair share of mysteries and bad, bad, bad heist plans. I will save the long pitch; for those of you interested, just head over to friendsatthetable.cash for that.

Before I go, I just want to thank my incredible players: Art Martinez-Tebbel, Keith J. Carberry, Janine Hawkins, Andrew Lee Swann, and Andi Clare, and my incredible production team, executive producer Alicia Acampora and composer Jack de Quidt, both of who also play characters, by the way, on top of making our show sound and feel incredible. Also, quick note, you can follow us over on twitter @friends_table.

That is gonna be it for me today; I tried to keep this a little bit briefer. I think I carved eight minutes off of the last time I did this, where I dove deep into the history of what an actual play podcast was, which was interesting to me but probably not very useful for people who are just like "what is this show I keep hearing about?" This is the show you keep hearing about! Go give it a listen. If you need more recommendations, again, you can ask us questions on twitter, just shoot us a message @friends_table. I am so, so, so proud of the stories that we have told together over the last three years; there's nothing I'm more proud of than the work I get to do here with my friends, and there's nothing more invigorating than hearing from fans what the show means to them, so.

Thank you for being part of the show, as a cast-member if you're listening, as a part of the production team, Jack and Ali, as a fan - so many people who have contributed fanart, fanfiction, have written songs about the show, have done covers of the music that Jack has written for the show. [Marielda theme begins playing in the background] All of that makes me light up inside, and it has been one of those years where I have needed that so badly, so thank you so much. And if you're new, thank you too. I would really love for you to give us- to give it a shot. You know, and if it doesn't take, it doesn't take, but I think it's the sort of show that deserves a little bit of time, and deserves the effort to see if it is something you'd like before moving on. So, thank you for your time, and thank you all for your support. I am so excited to see where we go from here. Peace.
